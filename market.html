    <center><p class = "content"> In a world where it's hard to tell what harsh preservatives and chemicals exist in the food we eat, Farmer's Markets are a safe solace from the harshness of heavily processed foods. Food comes straight from a local farm to a booth at the market, where a hardworking neighborhood farmer proudly showcases his collection and hopes to add some organic produce and meats to your diet. </p></center>

  <center><h4 class = "headers"> Why should we support Farmer's Markets? </h4></center>
    <center><p class = "content"> The U.S. Department of Agriculture believes that the strongest reason you should buy your fruits, veggies, and meats from farmer's markets is because it guarantees that you are consuming fresh and locally-grown foods. In addition, you'd be supporting a local farmer who works hard to provide your community with fresh produce, and helps circulate more money into your community that can be used to expand the fresh produce being grown! Knowing that your food is being grown nearby and by a smaller business, not a corporation, helps ease the tension of knowing what exactly is in the food you consume. There's nothing as comforting as produce grown right in your city! </p></center>
